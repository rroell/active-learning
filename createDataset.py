"""
This script reads the 'fashion challenge' dataset from an Excel file, preprocesses the data, and saves it into a CSV file.

The preprocessing involves selecting specific columns to keep, modifying the image paths to include the directory prefix, 
dropping all rows where 'product_sub_category' is 'N/D', and adding four new columns: 'annotation', 'score', 
'prediction', and 'top5'. These new columns are initialized as None and are meant to be populated in later steps.

After preprocessing, the resulting DataFrame is saved as a CSV file.

Global Variables
----------------
FILE_NAME : str
    The name of the CSV file where the resulting DataFrame is saved.
columns_to_keep : list
    The list of columns from the original dataset to keep during preprocessing.
