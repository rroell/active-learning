    """
    Custom Dataset for loading CLIP model inputs.

    Inherits from the PyTorch Dataset class. Designed to load images and 
    labels for use in a CLIP model, with pre-processing applied to the images.

    Attributes
    ----------
    image_paths : list
        A list of paths to the image files.
    labels : list
        A list of labels corresponding to each image.
    # NOTE: preprocess is also done in CLIPImageClassifier class. Might have to delete one of them?
    preprocess : callable
        The preprocessing function to apply to images before inputting them into the model.
    """

        Initialize the CLIPDataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image_paths : list
            A list of paths to the image files.
        labels : list
            A list of labels corresponding to each image.
        preprocess : callable
            The preprocessing function to apply to images before inputting them into the model.

        """
        Get a single item from the dataset at the specified index.

        Parameters
        ----------
        index : int
            The index to retrieve.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            A tuple containing the preprocessed image and its corresponding label tokenized.
